# 1502. Can Make Arithmetic Progression From Sequence

A sequence of numbers is called an __arithmetic progression__ if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers _arr_, return _true_ if the array can be rearranged to form an arithmetic progression. Otherwise, return _false_.

 

__Example 1__:
> __Input__: arr = [3,5,1]
> __Output__: true
> __Explanation__: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.

__Example 2__:
> __Input__: arr = [1,2,4]
> __Output__: false
> __Explanation__: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.

 

__Constraints__:
- 2 <= arr.length <= 1000
- -106 <= arr[i] <= 106

# About the solution: 
Please, don't mind me, i'm still trying to learn, so maybe this is not the best solution (which i totally belive it's not). Also, i'm plannning to come back to this later with more knowledhe to try to solve this in a better way :D
PS.: I don't know why but i did in Python '-'
