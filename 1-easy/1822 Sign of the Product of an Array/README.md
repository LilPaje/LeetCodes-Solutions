# 1822. Sign of the Product of an Array

Implement a function _signFunc(x)_ that returns:

- _1_ if _x_ is positive.
- _-1_ if _x_ is negative.
- _0_ if _x_ is equal to _0_.

You are given an integer array _nums_. Let _product_ be the product of all values in the array _nums_.

Return _signFunc(product)_.

 

__Example 1__:
> __Input__: nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,3,2,1]
> __Output__: 1
> __Explanation__: The product of all values in the array is 144, and signFunc(144) = 1

__Example 2__:
> __Input__: nums = [1,5,0,2,-3]
> __Output__: 0
> __Explanation__: The product of all values in the array is 0, and signFunc(0) = 0

__Example 3__:
> __Input__: nums = [-1,1,-1,1,-1]
> __Output__: -1
> __Explanation__: The product of all values in the array is -1, and signFunc(-1) = -1

 

__Constraints__:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- -100 <= nums[i] <= 100

# About the solution:
Please, don't mind me, i'm still trying to learn, so maybe this is not the best solution (which i totally belive it's not). Also, i'm plannning to come back to this later with more knowledhe to try to solve this in a better way :D
PS.: I'll stop using python in a moment!
