# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String


Given two strings _needle_ and _haystack_, return the index of the first occurrence of _needle_ in _haystack_, or _-1_ if _needle_ is not part of _haystack_.

 

__Example 1__:

> __Input__: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
> __Output__: 0
> __Explanation__: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

__Example 2__:

> __Input__: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
> __Output__: -1
> __Explanation__: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.

 

__Constraints__:

- 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
- haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

# About the solution: 
Please, don't mind me, i'm still trying to learn, so maybe this is not the best solution (which i totally belive it's not). Also, i'm plannning to come back to this later with more knowledhe to try to solve this in a better way :D
