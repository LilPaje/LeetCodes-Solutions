# 283. Move Zeroes

Given an integer array _nums_, move all _0_'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

__Example 1__:
> __Input__: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
> __Output__: [1,3,12,0,0]

> __Example 2__:
> __Input__: nums = [0]
> __Output__: [0]

 

__Constraints__:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1


# About the solution: 
Please, don't mind me, i'm still trying to learn, so maybe this is not the best solution (which i totally belive it's not). Also, i'm plannning to come back to this later with more knowledhe to try to solve this in a better way :D
