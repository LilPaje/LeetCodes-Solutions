# 389. Find the Difference

You are given two strings __s__ and __t__.

String __t__ is generated by random shuffling string __s__ and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to __t__.

 

__Example 1__:

> __Input__: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
> __Output__: "e"
> __Explanation__: 'e' is the letter that was added.

__Example 2__:

> __Input__: s = "", t = "y"
> __Output__: "y"

 

__Constraints__:

- 0 <= s.length <= 1000
- t.length == s.length + 1
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

# About the solution: 
Please, don't mind me, i'm still trying to learn, so maybe this is not the best solution (which i totally belive it's not). Also, i'm plannning to come back to this later with more knowledhe to try to solve this in a better way :D
PS.: This is me using an algorithm (Insertion Sort) i just learned from a book hehehe
