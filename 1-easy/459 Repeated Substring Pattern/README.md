# 459. Repeated Substring Pattern

Given a string s, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. 

__Example__ 1:
> __Input__: s = "abab"
> __Output__: true
> __Explanation__: It is the substring "ab" twice.

__Example 2__:
> __Input__: s = "aba"
> __Output__: false

__Example 3__:
> __Input__: s = "abcabcabcabc"
> __Output__: true
> __Explanation__: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.

 

__Constraints__:
- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s consists of lowercase English letters.



# About the solution: 
Please, don't mind me, i'm still trying to learn, so maybe this is not the best solution (which i totally belive it's not). Also, i'm plannning to come back to this later with more knowledhe to try to solve this in a better way :D
PS.: I don't know why but i did in Python '-'
