# 66. Plus One

You are given a large integer represented as an integer array _digits_, where each _digits[i]_ is the _ith_ digit of the integer. The digits are ordered from most significant to least significant in left-to-right order. The large integer does not contain any leading _0_'s.

Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

 

__Example 1__:
> __Input__: digits = [1,2,3]
> __Output__: [1,2,4]
> __Explanation__: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].

> __Example 2__:
> __Input__: digits = [4,3,2,1]
> __Output__: [4,3,2,2]
> __Explanation__: The array represents the integer 4321.
Incrementing by one gives 4321 + 1 = 4322.
Thus, the result should be [4,3,2,2].

__Example 3__:
> __Input__: digits = [9]
> __Output__: [1,0]
> __Explanation__: The array represents the integer 9.
Incrementing by one gives 9 + 1 = 10.
Thus, the result should be [1,0].

 

__Constraints__:
- 1 <= digits.length <= 100
- 0 <= digits[i] <= 9
- digits does not contain any leading 0's.

# About the solution: 
Please, don't mind me, i'm still trying to learn, so maybe this is not the best solution (which i totally belive it's not). Also, i'm plannning to come back to this later with more knowledhe to try to solve this in a better way :D
PS.: Python Again?
