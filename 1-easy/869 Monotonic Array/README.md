# 896. Monotonic Array

An array is __monotonic__ if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.

An array _nums_ is monotone increasing if for all _i_ _<=_ _j_, _nums[i]_ _<=_ _nums[j]_. An array _nums_ is monotone decreasing if for all _i_ _<=_ _j_, _nums[i]_ _>=_ _nums[j]_.

Given an integer array _nums_, return _true_ __if the given array is monotonic__, or _false_ otherwise.

 

__Example 1__:
> __Input__: nums = [1,2,2,3]
> __Output__: true

__Example 2__:
> __Input__: nums = [6,5,4,4]
> __Output__: true

__Example 3__:
> __Input__: nums = [1,3,2]
> __Output__: false

 

__Constraints__:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- -105 <= nums[i] <= 105

# About the solution: 
Please, don't mind me, i'm still trying to learn, so maybe this is not the best solution (which i totally belive it's not). Also, i'm plannning to come back to this later with more knowledhe to try to solve this in a better way :D
PS.: I don't know why but i did in Python '-'
