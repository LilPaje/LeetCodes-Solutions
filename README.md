# LeetCodes-Solutions

This repo is basically some solutions i wrote on leet code. Some are 0ms (the "C" ones), others not (the python ones), but this is a way to try to help you guys with a solution... Maybe you can learn from that and make it better. Or maybe i can learn from that in the future and make it better. Any way, thanks for stopping by :D. 

The Repo is divided by Difficulty, i'm Planning to divide the solutions in also by language, but let future me do this work.
